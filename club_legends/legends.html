          Ars√®ne Wenger is considered one of the best managers of all time after
          his amazing career at Arsenal beetween 1996 and 2018. One of his
          greatest achievements was leading the team to an unbeaten season which
          just shows how great he was. Not only did Wenger win lots of trophies,
          he was also a good dealer and knew when to sell or buy players. Most
          players were bought cheap and then transformed into world class
          players.
