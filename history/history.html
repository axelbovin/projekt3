          "The Invincibles" were Arsenals team during the 03-04 season when
          they went unbeaten in their 38 league matches. This team is one
          of the best teams in English history, if not the best. The team 
          had such balance in players and the partnership between Henry 
          and Bergkamp were amazing. Not to mention Viera's ability to 
          control the midfield and the fast wingers Pires and Ljungberg to 
          help the attack. With Sol Campbell and Kolo Toure at the back, 
          they did not concede many goals. Later the team were awarded a 
          special gold trophy to memorialize their achievement.

          Arsenal FC was founded in 1886 by some workers in southeast London.
          Five years later they became professional and after a couple of years 
          they were promoted to the First Division. After having some financial
          problems, Henry Norris bought the club and helped with the financial
          problems. In 1913 he moved the team to Arsenal Stadium in North London. 
          He then fixed so that the club got promoted to the First Division after 
          World War One. During the 1930's they became very successful by winning 5
           First Division titles and 2 FA cups.
